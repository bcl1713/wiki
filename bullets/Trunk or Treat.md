Coordinated with Top III, R6, ASGK, and American Legion to provide $1600 to sponsor trunk or treat event.  1112 members of the local community, 583 kids.
Community talked about boycotting the event due to $2 charge per person in attendance.  We avoided this by covering the cost.
I stood at the entrance to the event, handing out vouchers covering the cost of each attendee as they arrived, then we provided the money to the MWR afterward and divided the cost between the 4 orgs.
