## Topic: Concern for future of Manning at GK AWACS

- Tiered readiness happening at Tinker now:
  - Crews are allowing currency to drop
  - Re-Spin-Up prior to deployments and TDYs
- JSTARS are already retired
- No source of 1A3 Surveillance Ops or Radar Technicians with NATO required experience
- Other Nations send CRC personnel and Ground Radar MX:
  - Potential to x-code these positions?
- E-5 and Up and its role in EGA.  We cannot fit the Christmas Tree Mold:
  - Are we taking disproportionately from the Christmas Tree
  - EMA Crossflows same
- Chief said he would like to see a 1A3 Lessons Learned/State of the Union:
  - Address Stagnating Promotion Rates
  - Lessons learned from JSTARS divestment
  - Going forward with E-3 eventual divestment

## Big Picture Question

- Can we support the NATO E-3A to 2035?
- When are we green until (2025)?
- When are we yellow?
- When are we red?

## Note of Caution

- With MFA coming online, old 1A1 AFSCs were removed from myPers.
- This means that any backdated duty title change post merger, cannot be put under the old AFSCs
- For example:
  - SMSgt Golden becomes a 1A192F on 1 November 2023.
  - He went into student status on 15 October.
  - If you try to back date his duty title to E-3A Student Flight Engineer on 15 November:
    - His AFSC will show as changed on 15 October with the new AFSC or
    - You will have to update his duty title late
  - What's worse is if you need to go back and fix old records:
    - you will have to put them in with the new AFSC meaning he could potentially go from 1A170I to 1A172F back to 1A170I before the 1A1X2 career field even existed.
